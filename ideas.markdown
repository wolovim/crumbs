# only allow a user to upvote/downvote a question once

# redirect upvote/downvote to the index page, but if a question's content gets edited, it should redirect back to the question.

# get authorizations right
# 	users shouldnt be able to:
# 			- create positions for another user
# 			- edit/delete other users questions/answers/positions

# tags on questions
# 	- allow users to tag questions (free form vs from a list)
# 	- allow users to 'follow' tags/topics
# 			- users get those questions in their feed
